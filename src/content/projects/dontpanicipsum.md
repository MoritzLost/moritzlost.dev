A blind text generator using quotes from [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy). This was a side project that originated from rereading the entire book series and marking a bunch of memorable quotes on my Kindle. Built with plain HTML and some vanilla JavaScript to string together random quotes and apply the options in the configuration form.
