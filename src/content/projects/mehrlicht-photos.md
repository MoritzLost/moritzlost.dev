My personal photo website to showcase my hobby photography. The site supports browsing photos by project and by subject, and includes a page with my favorite photos as well as a photo blog.

Built as a static site generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Right now it's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and utilizes Netlify's now deprecated [Large Media](https://docs.netlify.com/build/git-workflows/large-media/overview/) feature for storing and delivering optimized images. I'm planning to rebuild this with Astro and move it to Cloudflare Pages.
