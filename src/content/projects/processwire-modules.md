During my time working with [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/), I developed a number of open source modules. Functionality included:

- Automatically finding page titles in text content and turning them into links.
- Adding hCaptcha support to ProcessWire forms.
- Utilities for having dynamic content in cached pages, and for easily clearing multiple caches.

I no longer actively develop those modules, but continue to fix small bugs and accept pull requests if something breaks.
