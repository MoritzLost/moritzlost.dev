Thomas Sausen interviewed me for his [CraftEntries podcast](https://craftentries.io) about my web dev career so far. We talk about my experiences with various CMS systems, particularly ProcessWire and Craft CMS. I also discuss how community engagement has helped me learn Craft and to grow as a developer.
