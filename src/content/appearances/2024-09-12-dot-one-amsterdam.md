title: "The unreasonable efficiency of Craft and git"
---

I gave a talk at [Dot One Amsterdam 2024](https://craftcms.com/events/dot-one-amsterdam-2024) about the synergy between Craft CMS and git. The session explores why Craft and its project config approach work particularly well for developer teams using a git-based workflows. It highlights Craft’s consistent version-control-first design, the clear distinction between config and content, and the importance of a declarative project config. I also discuss best practices and how to avoid some common pitfalls.
