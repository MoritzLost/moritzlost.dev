title: "The unreasonable efficiency of Craft and git"
---

I gave a talk at [Dot One Amsterdam 2024](https://craftcms.com/events/dot-one-amsterdam-2024) about the synergy between Craft CMS and git. The session explored why Craft and its project config approach work particularly well with distributed teams and git-based workflows. It highlighted Craft’s consistent version-control-first design, the clear distinction between config and content, and the importance of a declarative project config. I also discussed best practices for git integration with Craft CMS.
