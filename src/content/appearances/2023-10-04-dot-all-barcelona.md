My very first tech talk at [Dot All Barcelona 2023](https://craftcms.com/events/dot-all-2023) about optimizing the author experience in Craft CMS. I discuss a project where we had to optimize Craft's control panel for external contributors with no prior experience or training. The talk showcases several ways to utilize and extend existing Craft features, and build whatever is missing on top, without reinventing the wheel.
